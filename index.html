            <h2>Statistics for Healtcare Informatics</h2>
			<h2>Some resources for learning applied statistics using R</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2 class="content-subhead">Overview</h2>
			<p>These materials are intended to teach the following process for analyzing data in an applied setting: 
			opening a dataset, data exploration and cleaning, running descriptive statistics, 
			running desired inferential statistical tests, and interpreting and reporting results. 
			I intend to answer three questions about each step of this process: what, why, and how. 
			What should be done at each step? Why should it be done? How can it be done? 
			Since these materials are intended to focus on statistical analyses and using R, 
			I will only touch lightly on topics like study design. 
			Since this is material intended for individuals in healthcare informatics, 
			I will try to focus on examples and topics related to those areas.</p>
			
			<p>This course does not presuppose any particular statistical knowledge or 
			mathematics beyond basic algebra. Although the actual math involved in some of the models 
			we'll be learning can go well beyond that for those who should wish to pursue it and learn 
			more. These materials will focus on using statistics in an applied setting without needing 
			to get into the intricate details which are the foundation.</p>
			
			<p>It is my experience that learning statistics requires time and repetition. 
			I think some concepts from cognitive load theory seem applicable when trying to teach about 
			statistics. There is a certain amount of material we are able to digest within a given time 
			frame, and it also takes some time for our brains to process what we are taking in and turn it 
			into something we can eventually use. (The implication for students is to review the material 
			early in the week and don't leave it until the last possible second so you can give yourself 
			time to digest it.) I also feel Lev Vygotsky's concept of the zone of proximal 
			development is applicable, and enough material needs to be presented to challenge students but 
			not so much that it becomes overwhelming. It can be a tough balance to find. (Another implication 
			for students is to seek help early if you are having difficulty understanding the material 
			and figuring out what to do with it. This accomplishes two things: 1) you get help, 2) the 
			instructor knows how well what is being presented is being received.) In any event, you 
			may find you pick up some of the concepts presented here more readily than others. You will 
			probably find (should you choose to do it) when you come back later and review the material again you may pick up things 
			that you didn't get the first time around.</p>
			
			<p>A note about R and RStudio. I am not an expert in R. Most of my statistical training was 
			done in SPSS. What I'm showing here is one way to do things. If you know of a better, easier, 
			more efficient, more statistically sound way to do things by all means tell me about it. I'm 
			always learning and I'd like to give people the best information possible.</p>
			
			<p>A note about the materials listed here. I have read through a number of statistical texts 
			both as a student and as a tutor working with other students. I found the text by Andy Field 
			listed here to be the best balance between explaining theory, providing concrete instructions 
			on how to perform a test, and explaining how to interpret and report the results. Unfortunately, 
			his tone can be a bit too irreverent for many people's taste. However, I have not been able to 
			find a better text for balance between explaining theory and demonstrating practice, so I list 
			it as a resource here. Regarding the videos I link to, there are 
			an increasingly large amount of nicely produced YouTube videos available which explain statistical 
			concepts and demonstrate how to do things in RStudio. I link liberally to those where possible 
			because the production value is better than what I can currently produce myself and they have the 
			advantage that they are free and you can watch them as many times as you want any time you want. 
			If you know of a better video to explain a concept or demonstrate how to do something, please let 
			me know about it and send me a link.</p>
